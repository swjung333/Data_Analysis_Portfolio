# Data_Analysis_Portfolio

Welcome to my repository.

The following is a collection of my data analysis projects. This collection highlights data analysis and visualization projects using Python, SQL, and Power BI. Each project demonstrates how to transform raw data into actionable insights for interactive dashboards.

I aim to work with diverse data sources, leveraging SQL for querying and data transformation, Python for automation and exploratory analysis, and Power BI for visualizing trends and key metrics. Each project /is based on real-world statistics and includes detailed / follows a complete workflow: data collection, cleaning, transformation, analysis, and visualization, reflecting practical, real-world analytics processes.

These projects span multiple domains and include documentation explaining the methods, tools, and findings. This repository serves as both a portfolio of my work and a resource for those interested in data analysis, illustrating how Python, SQL, and Power BI can turn complex datasets into clear, actionable, and well-communicated insights.
