# Data_Analysis_Portfolio

Welcome to my repository.

The following is a collection of my data analysis projects. This collection highlights data analysis and visualization projects using Python, SQL, and Power BI. Each project demonstrates how to transform raw data into actionable insights for interactive dashboards.

I aim to work with diverse data sources, leveraging SQL for querying and data transformation, Python for automation and exploratory data analysis, and Power BI for visualizing trends and key metrics. Each project is based on real-world statistics and features detailed insights.

I hope my repository serves as both a portfolio of my work and an easy way to understand how data analysis works using Python, SQL and Power BI!
